## Making Your Decision

### Consider These Factors

**1. Number of Owners**
- Solo? → ETS
- 2-50 partners? → SARL
- 7+ shareholders? → SA

**2. Capital Available**
- Less than 10M XAF? → ETS or SARL
- 10M+ XAF? → Consider SA

**3. Business Goals**
- Small local business? → ETS or SARL
- Planning to grow large? → SARL or SA
- Need to raise capital? → SA

**4. Complexity Tolerance**
- Want simplicity? → ETS
- Comfortable with formalities? → SARL or SA

## Common Mistakes

1. **Choosing SA when ETS would work**: Don't overcomplicate if you're solo
2. **Not considering future growth**: Think about where you want to be in 5 years
3. **Ignoring capital requirements**: Make sure you can meet minimum capital needs
4. **Not consulting professionals**: Complex structures may need legal advice

## Changing Your Structure Later

You can change your business structure later, but it involves:
- Dissolving the current structure
- Registering the new structure
- Transferring assets and liabilities
- Additional costs and time

**Tip:** Choose wisely from the start to avoid this process.

## Next Steps

Once you've chosen your structure:

1. Reserve your business name
2. Prepare required capital
3. Gather necessary documents
4. Begin registration process
