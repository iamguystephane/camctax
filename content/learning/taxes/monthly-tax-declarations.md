# Understanding Monthly Declarations

All registered businesses in Cameroon must file monthly tax declarations (Déclaration Simplifiée des Flux or DSF) with the tax authorities. Missing deadlines can result in penalties.

## Who Must File?

- All businesses registered with a NIU
- Businesses with commercial activities
- Service providers
- Retailers and wholesalers

Even if you had no sales in a month, you still need to file a "nil" declaration.

## Filing Deadlines

- **Due date**: 15th of each month for the previous month
- **Example**: January sales must be declared by February 15th
- **Late filing**: Penalties apply after the deadline

## Required Information

Your monthly declaration should include:

### Sales Information

- Total sales for the month
- Breakdown by payment method (cash, bank, mobile money)
- Export sales (if applicable)
- Exempt sales (if any)

### Expenses and Purchases

- Purchases from suppliers
- Operating expenses
- Equipment purchases
- Service expenses

### Supporting Documents

Keep these ready:

- Sales receipts and invoices
- Purchase invoices
- Bank statements
- Mobile money transaction records

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing the deadline**: Set reminders for the 15th of each month
2. **Incorrect amounts**: Double-check all figures before submission
3. **Missing documents**: Keep all receipts organized monthly
4. **Not filing nil returns**: File even if you had no activity
5. **Incorrect business information**: Verify your NIU and business name
